### Welcome to the (State) Machine

Stateless all the thing, they say. In the last few years we’ve been brainwashed: design stateless systems, otherwise they cannot scale, they cannot be highly available, and they are hard to maintain and evolve. In a nutshell stateful is bad. However complex software systems need to do collaborative processing, that is stateful by definition. Stateless myth busted! Collaborative domains deal with long running business transactions and need to interact with distributed resources. The traditional distributed transactions approach, even if tempting, is a time bomb.

This is when Sagas come into play. Sagas allow to model complex collaborative domains without the need for distributed transactions and/or orchestration across multiple resources. Join Mauro on a journey that aims to disclose what sagas are, how they can be used to model a complex collaborative domain, and what role they play when it comes to designing systems with failure and eventual consistency in mind.

(It’s all right, I know where you’ve been)

### Product Owner is dead, long live Product Ownership

What if products were not managed by manager? Or even, what if there are no managers at all? Who will be responsible to define backlog priorities? In Particular Software there are no managers. Product management belongs to everyone. If this sounds like the inmates have taken over the asylum, you’re only partially right. Nowadays more and more companies are transitioning to adaptive organizational structures. What can be done to enable anyone to make decisions at any level? Is there a way to have a shared decision making process? We’ll have a look at how Particular Software is structured in order to enable all the above. We’ll analyze how problems are handled and which processes and tools we use to make decisions. All this without nurses, ooops, managers.
