Yesterday I had this fantastic opportunity to speak at [CloudConf2016](http://2016.cloudconf.it/) along with a group of amazing speakers and professionals.

It was an opportunity to meet new friends, compare and discuss ideas. I'd like to say thank you to the perfect organization, [Gabriele and Walter](http://www.corley.it/) are awesome hosts, and to all the attendees for this amazing experience.

By the way :-) I talked about SOA:

### The road to a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is paved with a message based infrastructure

*One of the options on the table when implementing a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is based on messages and an enterprise service bus (ESB), this talk will introduce messaging basic concepts, drive you through the basic SOA building blocks, and will connect the dots between the technology and the architectural principles, analyzing advantages and issues we may face when choosing this option.*

Slides are available on [SlidesShare](http://www.slideshare.net/mauroservienti/the-road-to-a-service-oriented-architecture-soa) and [GitHub](https://github.com/mauroservienti/Conferences/blob/2016/CloudConf2016/soa.pptx).
