You might already know that for living I work in the software industry, it has been my primary job for the last 16 years or so.
You might not know that my secret dream that is to be an artist :-) I studied classical dance when I was young and I always enjoyed being on stage. When it comes to dancing, classical dance in particular, getting older doesn't really help, so on the last few year my hobby moved from pure dancing to acting, singing and dancing in an amateur acting company.

Our current show is a reworked, and simplified, version of the awesome Mamma Mia.

Why am I telling you all these things? Well, last week I was asking myself are deadlines a bad thing?

We, the software industry, tend to say yes, deadlines and road apps are evil, we immediately connect them to waterfall and it's evil nature. I started thinking and comparing the software production process to what we did to setup the show and to be honest I'm not anymore so sure that deadlines and roadmaps are evil. Let me walk you through what does it mean to setup such a show.

From day zero to the first show it took us roughly 20 months, rehearsing for 2/3 times a week (3 to 4 hours each time), that means if my math is correct something like 700 hours. A huge effort, trust me, especially given that it's your free time, it's time subtracted to families and friends. Be aware that I'm not complaining, just highlighting a fact.

### The crew

18 people on the stage, 18 people among which 8 main characters and the corps de ballet, 1 dj, 1 light specialist and 1 jack of all trades. Out of the 18 composing the main crew 3 of them are also managing all the choreographies, 2 others all the logistic, 2 more all the legal stuff and finally 3 others take care of the direction, acting and singing, lights and music.

Is this in any way different from a development team?

### Suppliers

Then we have suppliers, scenographers and costumes makers. They are third party suppliers that must be involved into the development process at specific stages and have their own schedules and stuff to manage.

Do development teams have external suppliers? Consultant for example, can development teams expect a third party to be available on demand or the third party schedule needs to be carefully planned?

### The venue


### The logistic

When the scenography is more than 10 meters large and 3 meters tall you can't simply say tomorrow we'll be there, moving such a scenography requires a quite large truck and up to 6 people, the truck must be available as people, thus the move must be carefully planned in advance. The same happens with costumes, creating costumes took roughly 8 months.

### Interim builds and CI


### Beta and RC versions

### RTM

### refactoring and improvements

### the budget
