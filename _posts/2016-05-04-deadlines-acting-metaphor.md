You might already know that for living I work in the software industry, it has been my primary job for the last 16 years or so.
You might not know that my secret dream that is to be an artist :-) I studied classical dance when I was young and I always enjoyed being on stage. When it comes to dancing, classical dance in particular, getting older doesn't really help, so on the last few year my hobby moved from pure dancing to acting, singing and dancing in an amateur acting company.

Our current show is a reworked, and simplified, version of the awesome Mamma Mia.

Why am I telling you all these things? Well, last week I was asking myself are deadlines a bad thing?

We, the software industry, tend to say yes, deadlines and road apps are evil, we immediately connect them to waterfall and it's evil nature. I started thinking and comparing the software production process to what we did to setup the show and to be honest I'm not anymore so sure that deadlines and roadmaps are evil. Let me walk you through what does it mean to setup such a show.
